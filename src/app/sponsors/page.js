          Through financial funding support, the Leviathan team will be able to
          build an autonomous submarine to compete in the annual Naval
          Information Warfare Centerâ€™s RoboSub competition at no cost to
          students. This entirely student-run project will provide members with
          vital real-world engineering skills to prepare them for post-graduate
          success. Most importantly, through sponsorships, we will be able to
          maintain our tradition as the first underwater-vehicle project at UCR
          for the future generations.
