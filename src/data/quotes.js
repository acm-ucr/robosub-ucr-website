      "RoboSub provided me with a great opportunity to get engineering experience! Fellow team members and I have landed awesome internships and jobs and it is partly due to discussing our experiences we gained while on RoboSub during our interviews. This team provides students with the skills that employers are looking for. I have learned how to solve problems as an engineer and how to function more efficiently on a team. Being that each of our engineering teams are not too large, we are able to provide new members direct mentorship for tasks they take on.",

      "I joined this team because I wanted to continue my journey in the robotics and engineering field that I started in high school with FIRST robotics. UCR RoboSub gave me that and much more. Being at the university level, I learnt about simulations using Gazebo, designed models using SolidWorks and Blender, and adapted to the underwater mechanics of robotics. I also learnt how to work in more professional environments and adjust to online teamwork during the COVID-19 pandemic. This has been a fun, rewarding experience so far.",

      "RoboSub provided an environment where I could be constantly using technical skills and apply concepts taught in class. This allowed me to have a solid foundation to build new knowledge upon. It was through RoboSub that I learned about PCB design and assembly, which are not part of our curriculum, but is an essential skill for many electrical engineering jobs.",

      "If there was one thing I would change about my college career, it would be to join UCR RoboSub way earlier than I did. Being a part of this team has allowed me to apply concepts from basic physics all the way to fluid mechanics, mechanics of materials, modeling and analysis and machine design. Every task I was assigned or assigned to others were towards solving real world problems which results in a tangible product for the vehicle.The experience of working on technical challenges with a team allowed me to grow as an engineer and learn how to work with different types of engineers as well. My experiences at RoboSub have allowed me to intern at companies like SpaceX, NASA and start my career as a Mechanical Engineer at Raytheon. Apart from the professional and career development, I have made many new friends and met so many amazing people who I have thoroughly enjoyed working with. You have nothing to lose from joining UCR RoboSub and everything to gain!",
